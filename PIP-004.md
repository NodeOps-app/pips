**Title:** PIP-004: Activate Weekly Fee Module & Establish Adaptive Mint/Burn Mechanism for Sustainable Network Growth

**Summary**

This proposal activates the NodeOps Fee Module, enabling a fully automated weekly burn-and-mint cycle exactly as defined in the $NODE tokenomics. It formalises an adaptive, governance-controlled framework for the mint ratio (r) that evolves as the NodeOps ecosystem expands.

This strengthens long-term sustainability, fortifies token value accrual, and reinforces trust through full transparency and on-chain execution.

**Motivation**

NodeOps is entering its next phase of scale, expanding products, infrastructure, and ecosystem integrations. To support this growth, the token economy must be:

- Predictable
- Transparent
- Adaptive
- Aligned with real network usage

The Fee Module ensures that every dollar of utility generated by the network directly translates into protocol-level value for $NODE holders, using the native burn/mint equilibrium (BME) model:

- **Value In → Deflation via burns**
- **Network Growth → Sustainable issuance via minting**

This fully aligns network incentives with long-term adoption, making the economic engine more robust, self-reinforcing, and scalable.

**Specification**

**1. Activate Weekly Fee Module**

The Fee Module will execute the following every week, autonomously and on-chain:

- **50% of protocol fees** → collected in $NODE and permanently burned
- **50% of protocol revenue** → used to calculate governance-approved minting

All burns are sent to the existing public burn address on Ethereum Network
eth:0x2080FeE444118AFCe30fCb749802C18c0a980dB7

NodeOps already maintains a permanent on-chain burn address, publicly verifiable by the community. To date, **~3% of the total $NODE supply (20,365,011.9) has already been burned and sent to the burn pool through revenue-driven buybacks**.

All future burns executed by the Fee Module will continue to flow to this same immutable burn address.

This establishes a clear, transparent, and irreversible deflationary foundation for the $NODE economy.

This transitions NodeOps from manual execution to pure, rule-based, auditable token flows, making the economy more predictable and institution-friendly.

****2. Define & Activate the Mint Ratio****

This proposal formally establishes the **initial mint ratio (r)** for the Fee Module at **r = 0.20**

This parameter is the core switch of the economic model.

With r set at 0.20:

- 50% of revenue is burned
- 50% × 0.20 is minted
- Minting remains conservative, sustainable, and growth-aligned
- All actions are executed automatically, on-chain, weekly

This value ensures the network maintains strong value integrity while scaling its infrastructure, user base, and ecosystem presence.

****Governance Control****

The mint ratio (r):

- **Will not automatically change under any condition**
- **Can only be adjusted via future governance proposals**
- **Should only evolve as the network matures** — based on adoption, ecosystem growth, and collective community vision

This protects $NODE’s long-term sustainability while enabling the DAO to adapt responsibly as the protocol scales.

**3. Transparency & Community Alignment**

A dedicated public dashboard will provide:

- Weekly revenue captured
- $NODE burned
- $NODE minted
- Net supply delta
- Historical time-series
- Burn address balances
- Mint module events
- On-chain proofs of execution

This level of transparency positions NodeOps as a leader in economic clarity and tokenomics integrity.

**4. Execution & Security**

- All Fee Module functions are executed by audited contracts
- Weekly execution occurs automatically without manual intervention
- Governance retains administrative authority to tune parameters
- Emergency pause functionality is available for security
- Time-locked updates ensure responsible governance changes

**Expected Impact**

- Strengthens $NODE’s long-term value proposition through structured, predictable deflation
- Aligns token supply with real network utility
- Reinforces institutional and community confidence
- Creates a transparent, auditable, self-reinforcing economic loop
- Establishes NodeOps as a benchmark for economic integrity in Web3

****Next Steps****

Once this proposal passes, the following sequence will be executed:

****1. Mainnet Deployment****

- Deploy Fee Module + Revenue Router
- Configure weekly epoch scheduler
- Connect the module to existing burn address
- Enable on-chain event logging

****2. Activation of Automated Weekly Cycle****

- First weekly epoch Initializes
- Protocol revenue begins flowing through the Fee Module
- Burns and mints executed purely by code, without manual intervention

****3. Transparency Layer Release****

- Launch public dashboard
- Expose all key metrics: burns, mints, net supply delta, on-chain proofs
- Make dashboard accessible from the main NodeOps portal

****4. Governance Monitoring & Parameter Stewardship****

- Governance regularly reviews economic performance
- Any parameter tuning (e.g., updates to r) happens only through explicit governance voting
- Community weekly summaries and monthly analytics via a transparent dashboard

This structured activation ensures seamless rollout, institutional-grade transparency, and long-term sustainability.

**Vote Options**

- **FOR** - Activate the Fee Module with weekly burn/mint execution and adopt the adaptive mint ratio governance framework
- **AGAINST** - Do not activate the Fee Module

**Conclusion**

This proposal unlocks the full potential of the NodeOps token economy - strengthening fundamentals, reinforcing deflationary mechanics, empowering governance, and laying the foundation for scalable, sustainable long-term growth.

NodeOps becomes not only a leader in decentralized AI compute infrastructure **but a global benchmark for economic integrity in Web3.**
