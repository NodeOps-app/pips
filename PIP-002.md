**Title:** PIP-002: Ratify Protocol Parameters

**Summary**

This proposal seeks to confirm the Protocolâ€™s operating variables.

**Longer Description**

To initiate NodeOps Protocol, the DAO must ratify the value of the variables that enable and constrain its operation:

- **Compute provider:**
    - Provider registration bond: 2000 $NODE
    - Bond per CU (1CU = 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 30GB NVMe Disk): 200 $NODE
    - Minimum value of CU for a machine: 2CU
    - Unbonding period: 14 days
- **Bridge fees:** 5 NODE
- **Withdrawal** **fees**: 10 NODE
- **gNODE redemption:**
    - 100%: 150 days
    - 50%: 90 days
    - 25%: 30 days
    - 10%: 15 days

**Next Steps**

- If this resolution passes, meaning that quorum is met (the for, against, and abstain votes reach the 67% threshold of the eligible voting power) AND the 'for' vote is larger than the 'against' vote, the **parameters proposed in this PIP will be adopted and implemented within the Protocol.**
- If this resolution does not pass, the DAO will advance with a more granular process. A series of PIPs will be created, each isolating a subset of parameters (e.g., compute-provider economics). These individual proposals will allow token holders to vote independently on each configuration.
