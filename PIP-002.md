**Title:** PIP-002: Ratify Protocol Fees & Parameters

**Summary**

This proposal seeks to confirm the Protocol’s fees and associated operating variables.

**Longer Description**

The parameters defined in PIP‑002 serve as **initial configurations** to activate key functions of the protocol — compute provider registration, bonding, and fee accrual. These are not final values but a *baseline framework* that will be re‑evaluated periodically, particularly as $NODE’s market price fluctuates or network usage scales.

This flexible approach ensures that protocol fees and requirements remain fair, community‑aligned, and sustainable for long‑term ecosystem growth.

#### 1. Dynamic Parameters for Early Phase

The proposed values are set to help the ecosystem gain early traction and establish a strong equilibrium for the AI Compute layer.

However, as the $NODE market price moves, the DAO will retain the ability to adjust these parameters to maintain economic balance and accessibility.

#### 2. Fee Module as a Revenue Engine

The fee module is a foundational pillar for NodeOps’ economic sustainability.

Bridge and withdrawal fees not only ensure network stability but also introduce the next stage of **revenue streams** that will flow back to the DAO treasury and the $NODE buyback/burn framework — ultimately benefiting long‑term token holders.

#### Proposed Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Compute Provider Bonding fees** | Bonding fees required for provider onboarding | `2,000 $NODE` |
| **Per Compute Unit (CU) Bonding fees** | Bond per CU of active capacity | `200 $NODE` |
| **Unbonding Period** | Time before withdrawal post‑exit request | `14 days` |
| **Bridge Fee** | Fee applied to token bridging | 5 $NODE |
| **Withdrawal Fee** | Fee applied to unbonded withdrawals | 10 $NODE |
| Minimum value of CU for a machine |  |  2CU |
