**Title:** PIP-002: Ratify Protocol Fees & Parameters

**Summary**

This proposal seeks to confirm the Protocolâ€™s fees and associated operating variables.

**Longer Description**

To initiate NodeOps Protocol, the DAO must ratify the value of the variables that enable and constrain its operation:

- **Compute provider:**
    - Provider registration bond: 2000 $NODE
    - Bond per CU (1CU = 1 vCPU, 2GB RAM, 30GB NVMe Disk): 200 $NODE
    - Minimum value of CU for a machine: 2CU
    - Unbonding period: 14 days
- **Bridge fees:** 5 NODE
- **Withdrawal** **fees**: 10 NODE

**Next Steps**

- If this resolution passes, meaning that quorum is met (the yes, no, and abstain votes reach the quorum) AND the 'yes' vote is larger than the 'no' vote, the **parameters proposed in this PIP will be adopted and implemented within the Protocol.**
- If this resolution does not pass, the DAO will advance with a more granular process. A series of PIPs will be created, each isolating a subset of parameters (e.g., compute-provider economics). These individual proposals will allow token holders to vote independently on each configuration.

**Voting Options**

- Yes
- No
