**Title:** PIP-01: Confirm quorum threshold

**Summary**

This proposal seeks to demonstrate that NodeOps DAO is capable of meeting the quorum required for functional, decentralized, token-backed voting.

**Longer Description**

To initiate NodeOps Protocol DAO it must demonstrate the ability to form a quorum. The specific percentage needed for the quorum is currently defined as **67% of the eligible voting power.**

**Next Steps**

- If this resolution passes, meaning the 'Yes' vote is larger than the 'No' or 'abstain' vote, the quorum threshold will be officially adopted by NodeOps DAO as **67% of the eligible voting power.**
- If this resolution fails, a new quorum threshold must be proposed and voted on.

**Voting Options**

- Yes
- No
- Abstain
